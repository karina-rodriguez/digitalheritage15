abstract = {In order to support the work of researchers in the production, processing and interpretation of complex digital objects and the dissemination of valuable and diverse information to a broad spectrum of audience there is need for an integrated high performance environment that will combine knowledge base features with content management and information retrieval (IR) technologies. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of an integrated repository to ingest, store, manipulate, and export 3D Models, their related digital objects and metadata and to enable efficient access, use, reuse and preservation of the information, ensuring referential and semantic integrity. The repository design is based on an integrated coherent conceptual schema that models complex metadata regarding provenance information, structured models, formats, compatibility of 3D models, historical events and real world objects. This repository is not implemented just to be a storage location for digital objects; it is meant to be a working integrated platform for distant users who participate in a process chain consisting of several steps. A first prototype, in the field of Cultural Heritage, has already been implemented in the context of 3D-COFORM project, an integrated research project funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013, no 231809) and the results are satisfactory, proving the feasibility of the design decisions which are absolutely new, ambitious, and extraordinarily generic for e-science.}

problems. First of all it has to be able to deal with noisy input data and
outliers. Furthermore it should be capable of handling multiple data set
mixtures.   

The decreasing exponential approach is robust towards outliers and multiple
data set mixtures. It is able to fit a parametric model to a given point
cloud. As parametric models use a description which may not only contain a
generative shape but information about the inner structure of an object,
the
presented approach can enrich measured data with an ideal description. This
technique offers a wide range of applications.},

Our construction is primarily based on a novel notion of generalized rotational symmetry axis ({ROSA)} of an oriented point set. Specifically, given a subset S of oriented points, we introduce a variational definition for an oriented point that is most rotationally symmetric with respect to S. Our formulation effectively utilizes normal information to compensate for the missing data and leads to robust curve skeleton computation over regions of a shape that are generally cylindrical. We present an iterative algorithm via planar cuts to compute the {ROSA} of a point cloud. This is complemented by special handling of non-cylindrical joint regions to obtain a centered, topologically clean, and complete {1D} skeleton. We demonstrate that quality curve skeletons can be extracted from a variety of shapes captured by incomplete point clouds. Finally, we show how our algorithm assists in shape completion under these challenges by developing a skeleton-driven point cloud completion scheme.},

  abstract = {Salient edges are perceptually prominent features of a surface. Most
              previous extraction schemes utilize the notion of ridges and valleys
              for their detection, thereby requiring curvature derivatives which
              are rather sensitive to noise. We introduce a novel method for salient
              edge extraction which does not depend on curvature derivatives. It
              is based on a topological analysis of the principal curvatures and
              salient edges of the surface are identified as parts of separatrices
              of the topological skeleton. Previous topological approaches obtain
              results including non-salient edges due to inherent properties of
              the underlying algorithms. We extend the profound theory by introducing
              the novel concept of separatrix persistence, which is a smooth measure
              along a separatrix and allows to keep its most salient parts only.
              We compare our results with other methods for salient edge extraction.},

	for triangle meshes based on fitting primitives belonging to an arbitrary
	set. The method proposed is completely automatic, and generates a
	binary tree of clusters, each of which is fitted by one of the primitives
	employed. Initially, each triangle represents a single cluster; at
	every iteration, all the pairs of adjacent clusters are considered,
	and the one that can be better approximated by one of the primitives
	forms a new single cluster. The approximation error is evaluated
	using the same metric for all the primitives, so that it makes sense
	to choose which is the most suitable primitive to approximate the
	set of triangles in a cluster. Based on this approach, we have implemented
	a prototype that uses planes, spheres and cylinders, and have experimented
	that for meshes made of 100 K faces, the whole binary tree of clusters
	can be built in about 8 s on a standard {PC.} The framework described
	here has natural application in reverse engineering processes, but

	with a novel concavity-sensitive weighting scheme. Isolines sampled
	from the concavity-aware fields naturally gather at concave seams,
	serving as good cutting boundary candidates. In addition, the fields
	provide sufficient information allowing efficient evaluation of the
	candidate cuts. We perform a summarization of all field gradient
	magnitudes to define a score for each isoline and employ a score-based
	greedy algorithm to select the best cuts. Extensive experiments and

  abstract = {{3D} mesh segmentation is a fundamental low-level task with applications
	in areas as diverse as computer vision, computer-aided design, bio-informatics,
	and {3D} medical imaging. A perceptually consistent mesh segmentation
	{(PCMS)}, as defined in this paper is one that satisfies 1) in- variance
	to isometric transformation of the underlying sur- face, 2) robust
	to the perturbations of the surface, 3) ro- bustness to numerical
	noise on the surface, and 4) close conformation to human perception.
	We exploit the intelli- gence of the heat as a global structure-aware
	message on a meshed surface and develop a robust {PCMS} scheme, called
	{Heat-Mapping} based on the heat kernel. There are three main steps
	in {Heat-Mapping.} First, the number of the seg- ments is estimated
	based on the analysis of the behavior of the Laplacian spectrum.
	Second, the heat center, which is defined as the most representative
	vertex on each segment, is discovered by a proposed heat center hunting
	algorithm. Third, a heat center driven segmentation scheme reveals
	the {PCMS} with a high consistency towards human perception. Extensive
	experimental results on various types of models verify the performance
	of {Heat-Mapping} with respect to the consistent segmentation of
	articulated bodies, the topologi- cal changes, and various levels
	of numerical noise.},

  abstract = {Mesh segmentation has become a key ingredient in many mesh applications
	in computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical segmentation
	that decomposes a polygonal object into meaningful parts in such
	a way that not only components on a higher level reveal higher degree
	of salience than their descendant parts but also the components on
	each level of hierarchy have similar degree of salience. Moreover,
	the number of boundaries on each level of the hierarchy is determined
	automatically. The proposed segmentation is based on the Minimum
	Slice Perimeter {(MSP)} function [1], which represent non-local shape
	features and has better interpretation for the object parts. The
	gradient of {MSP} function is used to locate the segmentation regions
	and a new measure of part salience is proposed to evaluate the significance
	of the segmentation regions. For each level of hierarchy, some most
	perceptually significant segmentation regions are selected based
	on their salience measures and boundaries are then computed from
	the selected segmentation regions by using a capacity that considers
	both the curvature and {MSP} gradient.},

	Given a segmentation, produced either by an automatic segmentation

	algorithms, our method allows the boundaries to pass through the
	mesh faces, resulting in smoother curves, particularly visible on
	coarse meshes. The method is also capable of changing the number
	of segments, by enabling splitting and merging of boundary curves
	during the process. Finally, by changing the propagation rules, it
	is possible to segment the mesh by a variety of criteria, for instance
	geometric-meaningful segmentations, texture-based segmentations,

  abstract = {We propose a mesh segmentation algorithm via recursive bisection where
	at each step, a sub-mesh embedded in {3D} is first spectrally projected
	into the plane and then a contour is extracted from the planar embedding.
	We rely on two operators to compute the projection: the well-known
	graph Laplacian and a geometric operator designed to emphasize concavity.
	The two embeddings reveal distinctive shape semantics of the {3D}
	model and complement each other in capturing the structural or geometrical
	aspect of a segmentation. Transforming the shape analysis problem
	to the {2D} domain also facilitates our segmentability analysis and
	sampling tasks. We propose a novel measure of the segmentability
	of a shape, which is used as the stopping criterion for our segmentation.
	The measure is derived from simple area- and perimeter-based convexity
	measures. We achieve invariance to shape bending through multi-dimensional
	scaling {(MDS)} based on the notion of inner distance. We also utilize
	inner distances to develop a novel sampling scheme to extract two
	samples along a contour which correspond to two vertices residing
	on different parts of the sub-mesh. The two samples are used to derive
	a spectral linear ordering of the mesh faces. We obtain a final cut
	via a linear search over the face sequence based on part salience,
	where a choice of weights for different factors of part salience
	is guided by the result from segmentability analysis.},

	for annotating {3D} worlds for the net are characterized by top-down
	approaches, where selected authors annotate {3D} worlds in relation

	hypertextual web - permits to users to freely annotate objects and

	This work introduces a web-based specification, a software architecture
	and a set of interfaces for annotating {3D} worlds. The proposal
	is based on the {X3D} standard and enables both top-down and bottom-up
	annotation styles. The components of the software architecture -
	named {ToBoA-3D} - can be used in different scenarios, ranging from
	the complete management of a centralized set of annotated {3D} worlds
	to the creation of a network of top-down annotated {3D} worlds distributed
	on the net. Besides, the solution proposed can be applied to many
	{X3D} worlds already available on the net, without compromising the
	interaction possibilities implemented by the world designers. The
	architecture includes a search module that may use the annotations
	retrieved during the browsing phase for triggering the research of
	other objects and spaces that share the same labels but are part
	of other {3D} worlds. The integration of navigation and searching
	- introduced in {ToBoA-3D} - represents an important feature that
	may improve the findability of the resources. Such integration represents
	one of the winning features of the hypertextual web, but it is it
	still unavailable for most of the {3D} worlds for the net. The paper
	defines also an enhanced model for defining the spatial limits of
	complex spaces, that is used as a basis for annotating these entities.

  abstract = {Mesh partitioning and skeletonisation are fundamental for many computer
	graphics and animation techniques. Because of the close link between
	an object’s skeleton and it’s boundary, these two problems are
	in many cases complementary. Any partitioning of the object can assist
	in the creation of a skeleton and any segmentation of the skeleton
	can infer a partitioning of the object. In this paper, we consider
	these two problems on a wide variety of meshes, and strive to construct
	partitioning and skeletons which remain consistent across a family
	of objects, not a single one. Such families can consist of either
	a single object in multiple poses and resolutions, or multiple objects
	which have a general common shape. To achieve consistency, we base
	our algorithms on a volume-based shape-function called the shape-diameterfunction
	{(SDF)}, which remains largely oblivious to pose changes of the same
	object and maintains similar values in analogue parts of different
	objects. The {SDF} is a scalar function defined on the mesh surface,
	however, it expresses a measure of the diameter of the object’s
	volume in the neighborhood of each point on the surface. Using the
	{SDF} we are able to process and manipulate families of objects which
	contain similarities using a simple and consistent algorithm: consistently
	partitioning and creating skeletons among multiple meshes.},

abstract = {Traditionally, 3D acquisition technologies have been used to record heritage artefacts and to support specific tasks such as conservation or provenance verification. These exercises are usually a one-off as the technology and resources required are cost intensive. However, there is a recent impetus on the creation of 3D collections to document heritage artefacts which are semantically enriched by using annotations. A requirement of these solutions is the ability to support several representations of a heritage artefact recorded through time. This paper will propose an infrastructure to systematically enrich 3D shapes in a collection by using propagated annotations. In addition, it will describe the mechanisms for annotating, propagating and structuring the annotations using the CIDOC-CRM ontology. The results of this research have the potential to support heritage organisations in making their semantically rich 3D content available to a wider audience of professionals.}

abstract = {Packing fragile heritage artefacts is a challenge almost all heritage organisations have to deal with when faced with the task of transporting or storing the artefacts. The packaging solution requires fitting the artefact correctly in order to ensure the protection and safety of the item; but also to be easy and cost effective to produce. Different techniques have been traditionally used, such as double boxing, padding negative spaces and cushioning braces. However, the introduction of 3D technologies for documenting these artefacts enables innovative uses of this data for packaging purposes. Hence, this paper proposes the use of the generative modelling language in order to produce unique 3D-fitted containers for packaging heritage artefacts which fit tightly the artefact, and can be made to be reusable and more durable than traditional packaging solutions. We propose to adopt an octet lattice as a low density internal structure to the proposed container. By combining the parametric package design, 3D meshes acquisition and 3D printing techniques, we present a technology based solution to the traditional problem of protecting these valuable artefacts for transportation and/or storing purposes.}

abstract = {This paper presents three different propositions for cultural heritage organisations on how to digitise objects in 3D. It is based on the practical evaluation of three different deployment experiments that use different methods and business models for mass 3D-acquisition. These models are: developing the skills of in-house staff within an organisation, the use of external professionals and using crowdsourcing as a mechanism for developing the 3D collection. Furthermore, the paper provides an analysis of these models, lessons learned and practical recommendations for cultural heritage organisations. The analysis includes considerations of issues such as strategy, size of the organisation, skills, equipment, object accessibility and complexity as well as the cost, time and quality of the 3D technology. The paper concludes that most organisations are able to develop 3D collections but variations in the result will be reflected by the strategic approach they place on innovative 3D technologies.}

As such, activities like design and manufacturing are being performed by companies located in different places and countries. This global engineering environment has led to the distribution of product life cycle information and knowledge affecting the collaboration throughout product development. Although information technologies, such as the internet, provide a partial solution to support such collaboration, there is still a need to support decision making by providing the right information and knowledge in the place, time and format required by the geographically distributed companies. This paper presents the research conducted to develop a digitalised representation of product life cycle knowledge to support e-manufacturing of injection moulding products. Such representation is the kernel of a Knowledge driven Collaborative Product Development &#40;KdCPD&#41; system to support the effective collaboration in a global engineering environment.",
